# Deep Fake Detection

Deep Fake Detection is a web-based application designed to identify manipulated videos using machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes Flask for the backend and provides an intuitive interface for users to upload videos for analysis. The machine learning model analyzes the video and returns whether it is a deep fake or a real video, helping to combat the spread of misinformation.

## Features

- **Deep Fake Detection**: Uses machine learning algorithms to detect whether a video is a deep fake or not.
- **Web Interface**: A simple and user-friendly interface for uploading videos for analysis.
- **Real-time Results**: Provides instant feedback on whether the video is real or manipulated.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The backend integrates a pre-trained deep learning model for video analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the web interface)
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Pre-trained deep learning models (TensorFlow, Keras, etc.)
- **Video Processing**: OpenCV or similar libraries for video frame extraction and analysis

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Flask for creating the backend
- Required Python libraries for machine learning (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, etc.)
